# Rice Type Detection
Rice Type Detection is a deep learning-based project that classifies different rice varieties using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning with MobileNetV4. Developed in Jupyter Notebook within VS Code, this project involves image preprocessing, augmentation, and model accuracy evaluation to ensure high-performance classification. The model is deployed using Flask, enabling seamless integration into real-world applications. With a focus on efficiency and accuracy, GrainPalette enhances agricultural and food industry processes by automating rice type identification.
